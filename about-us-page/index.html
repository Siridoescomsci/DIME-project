                <p>DocTalk is a medical assistance app that provides patients with immediate access to their doctors. The way it works is quite simple. Firstly, patients must sign up using their real name, address, and email. 
				Then, the app will list the nearest doctors and GPs to you. You can then choose the practitioners that you would like to have contact with from the provided list or look up your doctorâ€™s name if they are not listed.
				You will then be able to send your doctor(s) a text message or request a video call with them. Your doctor can even provide you with prescriptions through the DocTalk app! </p>
