<h2>About Our Product</h2>
<section class = "information">
    <br>
    <p>
      Welcome to our website, home of the DocTalk App and its developers.

We are a small team that developed our app as we found the health system in Ireland being inaccessible and not moving forward with the technological world. As well as the hospital database being hacked regularly, we wanted to create an app that would have encrypted end-to-end connection between patients and the hospital to exchange info.  People suffering with chronic illnesses may especially need frequent doctor visits and/or their symptoms monitored closely from home by doctors which we took into consideration while creating the app. 
<br>
<br> At DocTalk App we aim to increase the comfort and quality of life of people with chronic diseases.

Our app allows users that suffer from chronic diseases to easily: <br><br>
<ul>
<li>Access doctors at their chosen hospital</li>
<li>Access information on their symptoms, without medical jargon</li>
<li>Log in their symptoms which are monitored daily by doctors</li>
<li>Log in their medication taken to keep track daily</li>
<li>Book appointments online in app</li>
<li>Easily get in touch with hospital incase of emergency</li>
</ul>
